## Summary
This is the first time I have used ASP<span></span>.NET Web API and deployed an app to Azure. The app allows the user to view a random tweet from a selection of my favorite Twitter users. The app also allows the user to search for tweets based on a keyword, or search for a users latest tweets.

I enjoyed creating this app as it enabled to learn more C# and .NET. I was also able to use React and .NET together, and that was a great learning experience.
